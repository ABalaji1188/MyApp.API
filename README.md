I'm passionate about building scalable and clean backend systems using .NET Core, C#, Entity Framework, and modern architecture patterns like Clean Architecture.

ðŸ“Œ Iâ€™ve recently shared a hands-on project demonstrating these concepts in action:
ðŸ”— MyApp.API â€“ Clean Architecture Web API on GitHub

ðŸŽ¯ Iâ€™m always looking to connect with:
âœ… .NET developers & software engineers
âœ… Tech leads & architects
âœ… Recruiters in the software engineering space
âœ… Anyone interested in clean code, APIs, and modern backend systems

ðŸ’¬ Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, and grow together in the tech community!

Feel free to drop me a message or check out my work.
